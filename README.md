# Computer-ScienceII
Writing larger programs and designing and implementing classical abstract data types such as list, stack, queue, binary search tree, graph, priority queue, hash table. Topics include string processing and recursion; data abstraction, encapsulation, and structure implementation; object-oriented program design; specification, implementation and application of these traditional ADTs. The course also emphasizes dynamic memory allocation, search and sorting algorithms, and introduces algorithm complexity. Designing and implementing advanced-level programming assignments are an integral part of the course.
