# Computer-ScienceII
Writing larger programs and designing and implementing classical abstract data types such as list, stack, queue, binary search tree, graph, priority queue, hash table. Topics include string processing and recursion; data abstraction, encapsulation, and structure implementation; object-oriented program design; specification, implementation and application of these traditional ADTs. The course also emphasizes dynamic memory allocation, search and sorting algorithms, and introduces algorithm complexity. Designing and implementing advanced-level programming assignments are an integral part of the course.
Course Outcomes:
- Upon course completion, a student will be able to:
- Demonstrate basic principles of program development and design
- Contrast basic concepts of procedural and object?oriented programming
- Utilize fundamental features of a higher level language, including event-driven programming, graphical user interface, and multi-threading.
- Demonstrate the implementation of abstract data types, such as list, stack, queue, priority queue, binary search tree, graph, and heap
- Describe the design and time complexity of algorithms.
- Apply the principles of networking, exceptions, and error-handling in a Java environment
